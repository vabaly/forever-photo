# Forever Photo

Forever Photo is a photo management app with local sync technology. It synchronizes albums and photos without the need for cloud servers. Unlike apps that only back up or transfer photos, it tracks changes to albums and photos for true synchronization.

Forever Photo offers:

1. Management of system albums and photos.
2. Synchronize photos between multiple devices. Forever Photo is compatible with most major operating systems such as Mac, Windows, Android, etc. and provides a consistent experience.
3. Track any changes to albums and photos. For example, if you sync a photo on your phone to your computer and move it to Album A on your computer, the next time you sync, the photo will also be moved to Album A on your phone. Further, if you delete a photo on your phone, the photo will be deleted on your computer the next time you sync.
4. Elegant design. Forever Photo has a minimalist design for a simple, consistent experience.
5. Privacy protection. Forever Photo never collects any of your personal information, all syncing takes place on your LAN, and any syncing between devices must be mutually authorized.
6. Transferring raw data. All photo metadata (EXIF, GPS, IPTC) is preserved.
